# TensorVis
This is a course project of CSCI596 to explore the visualization of tensor field

Typically, when in many high-fidelity simulations, we need to deal with tensors, which is hard to visualize. In this project, I explore the tensor visualization using Paraview. More specifically, after obtaining fluid simulation data from DNS (Direct Numerical Simulations), i.e., velocity, pressure, density field, I want to know the turbulence state of the flow, which can be quantified by Reynolds' stress. Then I use the programmable filter in Paraview to do Python coding and use it to compute the Reynolds' stress and visualize it.
